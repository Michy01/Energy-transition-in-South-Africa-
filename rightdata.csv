Date published: 30 jul 2021. Deputy chairperson of the commission, dr valli moosa. The executive director of the commission, dr olver. Thank you for this opportunity to engage again. the dmre welcomes the opportunity to engage with the commission on the just transition broadly, and to discuss the synergies with the work both the commission and the department are doing specifically on the just energy transition, and as far as our mandate and responsibility entails. I need to emphasise that this commission must engage with a diverse range of views, as this will allow us to also identify and focus on the blind spots in this complex discussion. this cannot just be a dialogue about financing and money, we need to understand the context of our domestic setting, which is characterised by rising unemployment and poverty. Let me further emphasize from the onset that as government, and in particular the ministry of mineral resources and energy, our key priority remains to ensure security of supply of affordable, accessible, and reliable energy as a catalyst for economic growth. therefore, our primary focus will be to continue working tirelessly to prioritise interventions that contribute to reducing high energy costs, whilst in parallel dealing with the high levels of unreliable supply of energy by stabilising the system through the implementation of the existing energy policy priorities. We want to take this opportunity to note and welcome ongoing dialogue on the proposed 2050 net zero pathways, and the contributions and engagement on the nationally determined contribution (ndc) under paris agreement ambition target by the commission. we are encouraged by the recognition that further ambition on ndc targets will be highly dependent on innovative international collaboration at technical, legal, and financial levels. we also support the collective belief that ambition can be realized through the requisite policy enablers and the means of implementation support by the developed countries, this as part of the rules based global governance order. Our efforts to shape resilience and to moderate and manage the transition risk will undeniably have to be framed in accord with national priorities and our sustainable development objectives and must consider context specific conditions. the transition is not and cannot be a one size fits all, violent pendulum swing. it is a process and a journey, and must be considered from its short-, medium- and long-term perspectives and outlooks. To this effect, we want to recall our previous input to this commission, where we indicated that we are pursuing the implementation of the integrated resource plan 2019 (irp 2019) as well as the national energy efficiency strategy (nees). at the same time, in collaboration with the dtic and other stakeholders, we are working to accelerate finalisation of the south african renewable energy master plan as well as the gas master plan. these instruments form part of providing a comprehensive energy framework with key objectives and targets on how to transition energy intensive sectors in south africa to a low-carbon path. The 2019 irp, which remains our guiding policy framework for electricity, proposes a path that ensures that we implement the proposed energy mix in a manner that also mitigates and manages the challenges and risks for a socially just transition that we will face, as the country moves to a low-carbon and climate resilient growth trajectory. energy security and market stability are key determinants for how we respond to various energy sources and choices. we therefore need to ensure that we take an open and balanced approach and try to avoid a competition of technologies, but rather to analyse and define the energy mix suited to our economic and developmental context. as such, we cannot avoid speaking about the role of gas and nuclear in our path towards lower carbon economy. for instance, the international energy agency, in both its net zero by 2050 and sustainable development scenarios, underline the critical role of nuclear fleets to low carbon transitions around the globe. as such, in the net zero pathways, amongst others, the iea sees renewable technologies and nuclear making up the global electricity supply system by 2050. we need to consider these matters in a frank manner, always underscoring the centrality of energy security and stability. We have observed a myriad of diverse efforts and initiatives on just transition and energy transition, albeit these are implemented in a fragmented and uncoordinated manner. at times these efforts create competing policy choice, and as such they are likely to render the efforts for just energy transition difficult to manage and quantify. we do hope that the pcc efforts in terms of setting the broad framework for just transition dialogue will allow for enhanced and stronger coordination and alignment. As part of our strategic commitment and delivery plan for this current financial year, we have conducted a study to map all these just energy transition initiatives to create a balanced, integrated, and enhanced effort that will enable us to ultimately agree on a pragmatic and balanced approach to the transition, and specifically a transition that is inclusive and does not leave anyone behind. the way we talk to the consequences of the decommissioning of coal power generation stations sometimes sounds like epwp is the option to replace jobs in the province. there is no appetite to discuss the alternative economic options, including for instance where gas is factored in as a low carbon technology, or even the application of advanced nuclear technologies in the form of smaller modular reactors. Work has commenced over the past few months on identifying key energy transition indicators relevant to our domestic context, as well as a modelling process that will look at the socio-economic impact of the implementation of the irp2019 mix of measures. while this work has not been fully presented to the broader commission, it has been consulted with some stakeholders, in anticipation of a broader public stakeholder engagement targeted at the third quarter of this year. It is in this context that it is important to forge continuous relations with the presidential climate commission, eskom, the departments of forestry fisheries and environment, public enterprises and national treasury on the one hand, and business labour, civil society to ensure concrete alignment of all efforts on just energy transition. We are pleased that the commission has initiated a steering committee to focus on among others, the specific energy transition issues, and we hope that this will be a great opportunity to rally not only the modelling expert capacity both within government and private sector, but also our social partners to work together on a common purpose. That will ultimately culminate in a clear, balanced, and inclusive framework for the implementation of the just energy transition. To this end, we hope that our collective efforts will be guided by the desire for realistic employment protection and diversification of opportunities for existing workers, compensation of the socio-economic impact of the transition and economic rejuvenation in especially coal areas; and importantly, ensuring energy security, in terms of both supply and affordability for south africa. we must continue to invest in cleaner coal technologies and innovation, and make sure that these options are not kept under the radar. some work is happening in this regard, and we need to intensify this effort. Therefore, as the department, we want to make the call to all stakeholders to act in a manner that contributes to a transition that ensures energy security as the flywheel for growth and development, that does not cause instability to the economy, that stimulate growth, build confidence, enhance competitiveness, but most importantly, create jobs through industrialised centred localisation and export sector growth. an engagement i have had with renewable energy sector players have accepted that manufacturing is not happening in this space, this must change, another area we need to engage on frankly. We are looking at the commission to discharge its responsibilities as an independent advisory body and to provide impartial support to our government in the development of the just transition, which ultimately should set the frame for how sectors, including the mining and energy sectors, will respond to our stated national objective of a low-carbon and climate resilient economy.

Rome, 28th january 2021 – res4africa foundation widens its field of action by welcoming csir and nedbank: joining a network of excellence from across the european renewable energy value chain, the leading research centre based in pretoria and the financial giant of sandton are the first south african organisations to take part in the assembly of res4africa members. their membership was approved and made official by res4africa’s steering committee, following a solid working relationship established between res4africa, csir and nedbank over the past few months. South africa is the largest electricity market in africa; despite the successful initiation of a renewable energy transition, today south africa’s power sector is experiencing some challenges. the country's economy is dependent on the extraction and export of coal, and its electricity demand has been weak and negatively influenced by frequent supply shortages, rising tariffs and lower economic growth. moreover, its generation mix is based on increasingly older plants, which reduces the reliability of supply, while new generation capacity addition has been slow to materialise despite the approval of the 2019 integrated resource plan that sets out a clear policy for the increased deployment of renewable energy sources. south africa’s renewable resource wealth offers tremendous opportunities for clean and sustainable power generation, which is expected to play a key role in addressing the supply demand imbalance and supporting economic growth and prosperity in the region. “the challenges that south africa’s power sector is experiencing offer the opportunity to scale up the deployment of renewable energy, which has the potential to ensure a more reliable and sustainable electricity service, at a fairer price” states salvatore bernabei, president of the res4africa foundation, “with its partners in south africa, res4africa is carrying out a dedicated programme focused on the country’s energy transformation. we therefore gladly welcome csir and nedbank as partners, a tangible result of the positive collaborations we’ve established over the past months”. Through the dedicated programme, res4africa aims to offer its support to south africa’s decarbonisation process, ensuring that the energy transition occurs in a just way, leaving no one behind. among its key deliverables, there are the release of the publication a just energy transition in south africa (developed in collaboration with csir and erm), an online event attended by more than 400 participants and which saw the participation of both csir and nedbank as speakers, and the launching of am-powering connexions, a series of monthly morning appointments addressed to the south african energy community to share ideas and resources and to create connections and engagement opportunities. “as the largest science council on the african continent, and with a specific focus on the industrialisation and application of new technologies, the council for scientific and industrial research (csir) is pleased to join the res4africa foundation. the csir's energy centre is the leading energy research institute in the region, with the vision ‘to provide the knowledge base for the south african energy transition and beyond’. the csir looks forward to continuing to make its contribution in the transition to sustainable energy sources and to improve the access to clean and affordable energy and to achieve the sustainable development goals set by the united nations. sub-saharan africa presents substantial opportunities for the development and deployment of renewable energy solutions. the integration of the work of the csir energy centre and res4africa foundation is hoped to have lasting positive impact on energy access, sustainability and equality” comments clinton carter-brown, head of the energy centre of csir. “as a bank committed to using our financial expertise to do good, we take seriously our commitment to helping to shape a better world through the realisation of the united nations sustainable development goals. (sgds), particularly ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and renewable energy for all. to this end, we are honoured to become a member of the renewable energy value chain that seeks to address energy challenges facing the continent, using our collective muscle, and membership of this august network positions the bank to contribute to this vital development”, concludes amith singh, head of energy finance of nedbank cib.

The redzs support the responsible implementation of the integrated resource plan (irp 2019) that was recently gazetted by the minister of mineral resources and energy on 17 october 2019. renewable energy projects that could be developed in these new redz have the potential to make significant contributions to mine rehabilitation and to support a just energy transition in the specified areas including where 12 gw of existing coal power stations are planned to be decommissioned by 2030. . The irp 2019 has identified the requirement for at least an additional 14.4 gw of wind and 6.0 gw of solar pv by 2030 amongst a range of other new-build capacity including coal, gas, imported hydro and storage.  there is a distinct need for rehabilitating areas where existing coal power stations are expected to decommission and possibly repurposing these for a range of diverse economic activities including renewable energy deployment which can be “fast tracked” if within the new redzs. The outcomes of the second phase of the sea for wind and solar pv energy in south africa were presented to stakeholders at the csir, in pretoria on 26th september 2019. this study was commissioned by the national department of environment, fisheries and forestry (deff). the two new redzs for pv are in the emalahleni and klerksdorp areas and the third one, which focuses on wind energy, is located to the east of beaufort west. Csir environmental scientist, abulele adams, conveyed that one of the main aims of the phase 2 sea was to identify previously mined areas close to the gauteng area where the highest demand for energy is, in order to incentivise large-scale solar pv projects in this area. “in this way, the new renewable energy projects can contribute towards the rehabilitation of previously mined areas, support job creation in the areas, especially where there may be a decline in mining, and potentially make use of existing infrastructure, such as the electricity grid and roads from previous mining activities,” she explained. she further emphasised that it is important to plan renewable energy development in these previously mined areas to ensure that renewables play a role in the just transition to a low-carbon economy. . The identification of the new redzs involved positive mapping (i.e. “pull factors”), which included factors such as the abundance of the existing wind and solar pv energy resources, access to the power corridors, and other technical criteria required for renewable energy facilities. this was followed by negative mapping (i.e. “push factors”), which included environmental features and areas that are sensitive to the placement of large-scale wind and solar pv facilities. thereafter, an industry prioritisation exercise was conducted to ensure that the proposed areas are aligned with areas that the renewable energy sector identified as priorities for future projects. Csir environmental assessment practitioner, paul lochner, highlighted that renewable energy development can still take place outside of the redzs. “such applications must be considered on a project-by-project basis,” he explained. he added that the redzs are also aligned with the powerline corridors that were identified in the electricity grid infrastructure sea completed in 2016 and gazetted as powerline corridors in february 2018. in this way, the combination of the redzs and power corridors provides strategic guidance to eskom on where to prioritise investment in grid infrastructure. This phase 2 sea follows the phase 1 wind and solar sea (completed in 2015), which identified eight redzs in south africa. these were gazetted for implementation by the minister of environmental affairs, in february 2018. The objective of the seas is to identify areas in the country that are best suited for wind and solar pv energy projects, based on a holistic assessment of technical, strategic planning, environmental and socioeconomic criteria.

The ndp aims to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality by 2030. according to the plan, south africa can realise these goals by drawing on the energies of its people, growing an inclusive economy, building capabilities, enhancing the capacity of the state, and promoting leadership and partnerships throughout society. The processes should be followed in the implementation of the plan:. The ndp and its proposals will need to be implemented in the right order over the next 17 years until 2030. three phases have been identified. The long term plans of departments are aligned with the ndp and areas areidentified where policy change is required to ensure consistency and coherence. The ndp is a plan for the whole country. government will engage with all sectors to understand how they are contributing to implementation, and particularly to identify any obstacles to them fulfilling their role effectively. The plan will shape budget allocation over the years until 2030. The plan identifies the improvement of  the quality of public services as critical to achieving transformation. this requires provinces to focus on identifying and overcoming the obstacles to achieving improved outcomes, including the need to strengthen the ability of local government to fulfil its developmental role. Planning and implementation should be informed by evidence-based monitoring and evaluation. The president and deputy president will be the lead champions of the plan within cabinet, in government and throughout the country. premiers and mayors must be visible and active champions of the plan, with their offices being the catalytic agencies to drive implementation at provincial and municipal levels.

28,www.engineeringnews.co.za,"Initial ‘just energy transition’ work points to need to cushion coal regions. Csir research group leader for the energy industry ntombifuthi ntuli. The council for scientific and industrial research (csir) energy centre has initiated a project to model the socioeconomic risks and opportunities associated with south africa’s transition from a coal-dominant electricity industry to one that is increasingly based on renewable energy. The project, which is being pursued under the theme of a ‘just energy transition’ for south africa, will be completed during the first quarter of 2020. The initial results indicate that the transition can deliver significant employment, social and environmental benefits. however, detailed planning and coordination is also required in order to limit potential social dislocation in coal regions. Csir research group leader for the energy industry ntombifuthi ntuli tells engineering news online that the study takes account of eskom’s planned decommissioning schedule for its older coal-fired power stations, most of which are located in the mpumalanga province. That schedule has remained more or less intact since the publication, in 2011, of south africa’s first integrated resource plan, known as irp 2010. it shows that, regardless of what new generation is installed, eskom will decommission 13 gw of coal capacity by 2030 and 28 gw by 2040. In addition, the csir has integrated results from a wide-ranging analysis conducted on the employment scenarios that are likely to arise from the implementation of the draft irp 2018. The document has since been revised by the department of energy in preparation for consultations by the social partners at the national economic development and labour council (nedlac). the modelling remains relevant, however, as the jobs impacts in the draft irp 2018 relate mainly to the decommissioning of the older coal stations, offset against the jobs that will be created by building and operating the generation plants introduced to replace that lost capacity, as well as to cater for demand growth. In all of the scenarios included in the draft irp, most of that supply is provided through a combination of new onshore wind, solar photovoltaic (pv) and gas-fired generation. Renewable energy is anticipated to contribute up to 246 000 jobs for solar pv and up to 344 000 jobs for wind energy by 2030 (accounting for direct, indirect and induced jobs for both construction and operation & maintenance phases over the irp period).  in 2030 alone, the sector creates about 110 000 direct, indirect and induced jobs, while gas will contribute about 55 000 jobs. Although coal remains the biggest employer in the sector overall in 2030, due to its larger share of total installed capacity, jobs across the coal value chain – including mining, manufacturing, operations and maintenance – will fall by about 100 000, from 287 000 in 2020 to about 183 000 in 2030 as a result of decommissioning. Ntuli says the analysis, which has been carried out using a customised version of the international jobs and economic development impacts (i-jedi) economic model, points to a net employment gain of nearly 30 000 jobs in the electricity supply industry by 2030, when compared with 2020, owing to new build capacity added by renewables and gas. In the absence of a specific intervention to cushion coal-dependent municipalities in mpumalanga, the socioeconomic impact of the decline could be devastating, csir energy economist for energy industry and markets ruan fourie cautions. In fact, fourie likens it to the scenario that played out in certain municipalities in the free state, when the gold mines began closing and mining sector jobs plummeted from 120 000 in 1993 to 38 000 by 2017. The csir has already completed economic baselines for certain “hot spots” and has concluded that action plans, coordinated at a national level, should be introduced to ensure these regions are cushioned during the transition. “the good news is that the new technologies to be introduced under the updated irp are not only cheaper than coal, but also more job-intensive overall,” ntuli states. The i-jedi model indicates, for instance, that by deploying solar pv in line with the yearly allocation outlined in the draft irp 2018 a total of 77 745 direct jobs, 79 479 indirect jobs and 85 405 induced jobs will be created during the construction phase between 2020 and 2030. Indirect jobs are created in the value chain and include manufacturing and professional services jobs, while the induced jobs arise from the fact that workers earning money on the solar projects spend that money in a way that creates manufacturing, retail and financial services jobs. The employment scenario for solar pv would be even better should the irp being considered in nedlac be adopted, as its eliminates the two-year hiatus in the deployment for solar pv in 2022 and 2023 included in the draft irp 2018 and raises the yearly allocation of small-scale embedded generators, which will mostly arise in the form of rooftop solar, from 200 mw to 500 mw. However, in the absence of specific policy intervention directing solar and wind developers to build their plants in territories such as mpumalanga, the majority of those jobs will be created in provinces with superior solar and wind resources, such as the northern cape. The csir is, thus, aiming to produce a ‘national just transition action plan’ that adds spatial and socioeconomic dimensions to the irp and provides an indication of what the integration of such components will mean for wholesale electricity tariff. For instance, the tariff sensitivity analysis may show that, while a project built in mpumalanga will be more expensive owing to the inferior solar or wind resource relative to a site in the northern cape, that additional cost could be mitigated or entirely offset by the fact that the project is in close proximity to established grid infrastructure. “we have yet to finalise that analysis, but we have already concluded that the just transition needs to be coordinated at national level, in line with the national planning commision’s ongoing pathways development for just transition.” ntuli concludes. .

Submit a job ad >>. #biztrends2021: just energy transition will continue to accelerate. The energy sector in south africa has changed more in the last decade than perhaps any industry, and arguably will change even more in the next decade. deregulation, the introduction of independent power producers' (ipps), requirements around carbon emissions, and the rapid fall in renewable tariffs have resulted in a material shift away from fossil fuels. this just energy transition (jet), as it is known around the world, has been accelerated by covid -19 and herein lies an opportunity for this transition to be used as a tool, one of several in government's toolbox, to kick-start the economy. Ben brimble, chair, sawea policy working group. The national energy regulator of south africa (nersa) recently provided concurrence for a ministerial determination (md) of 11,800mw of generation capacity (this includes wind, pv, gas and storage). in late september this md was gazetted and for all intents and purposes, procurement of new capacity can commence. this cannot happen soon enough; load shedding will continue into 2022 as the energy availability factor (eaf) of the eskom coal fleet hovers around 66% . this coal fleet is also reaching the end of its useful life and by 2030 up to 10,000mw of coal must be decommissioned . this capacity needs to be replaced urgently. The integrated resource plan (irp) is an energy policy and planning document, produced annually, that plots the generation mix required for the country for the following 10-year period. it applies a least-cost approach for the country and is technology agnostic, meaning that no technology is favoured. the 2019 iteration of the document shows significant procurement of renewables over the upcoming decade. specifically, wind and solar pv, with a proportion of gas and storage, were shown to be best for south africa. The time to implement the irp is now. it represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the government and other stakeholders to manage the energy transition, whilst facilitating significant foreign investment (r48.7bn cumulative foreign investment attracted by renewable energy between 2011 and 2015 ), job creation and injecting competitively priced energy onto the grid. this can be achieved by reviving the renewable energy independent power producer programme (reipppp). Wind energy in south africa is developed and constructed entirely at risk by independent power producers (ipps). no risk is carried by the government or eskom. at the end of the development process, a competitive auction process is held and the best projects from a tariff and economic development perspective are awarded purchase power agreements from eskom. Competitive tariffs are a result of several factors, not least of all the world class wind (and solar) resource that sa has to offer, but also improving technology with higher hub heights and rotor diameters in excess of 170m. the geographical spread of projects across the country also provides for an aggregated generation profile that will better match supply and demand – highly valued by the network operator and will reduce intermittency. with the inclusion of utility-scale battery energy storage, the notion of baseload and the often-trotted-out need for coal or nuclear generation, is fast becoming antiquated. it is clear that a mix of renewable energy with complementary flexible generation such as gas as well as battery energy storage, can adequately meet the energy demands of the country, in a least-cost scenario. This must be seen as the best outcome for the country: cheap and reliable power is a foundational requirement for any growing economy and as the country moves into a recovery state post-covid, it will become more important than ever. renewable energy has the potential to provide this if the correct enabling environment is provided by the government. capital will flow back into the country via the reipppp, jobs will be created, and small towns around the country will be reinvigorated, all of this while the least-cost generation is added to the grid. Ben brimble is the project manager for windlab developments sa, and heads up projects in south africa and mozambique, with many years' experience in other african markets, through the full development life cycle of wind farm development: from inception through to commercial operation. he is presently chair of the south african wind energy association (sawea) policy working group and is actively involved in helping to move the industry through the current energy transition.

The enel green power rsa (egp rsa) 145 mw garob wind farm situated in the northern cape, south africa, has successfully achieved commercial operation. .   johannesburg, 4 december, 2021 – garob wind farm, which is located near the remote northern cape town of copperton in the siyathemba local municipality, will be able to generate 573 gwh every year, potentially preventing the emission of approximately 600,000 tons of co2 into the atmosphere annually. The facility is situated in the northern cape province, an area that is fast becoming a renewable energy hub in south africa due to the growing number of solar and wind farms in the region. Awarded to enel green power in april 2015 as part of the fourth tender round of south africa’s renewable energy independent power producer procurement programme (reipppp), the wind farm is supported by a 20-year power purchase agreement south african energy utility provider, eskom. egprsa is working to enlarge its asset portfolio with new investments both for future regulated tenders and private ppas with south african industrial and commercial clients. This brings the number of operational enel green power rsa wind and solar sites in south africa up to 10 projects, with an overall installed capacity of more than 800 mw. The other sites are located in five provinces in the country, with nojoli (88 mw), gibson bay (111 mw), oyster bay (148 mw) and nxuba (148 mw) in the eastern cape; upington (10 mw), adams (82.5 mw) and paleisheuwel (82.5 mw) in the western cape; pulida (82.5 mw) in the free state; tom burke (66 mw) in limpopo; and now, garob in the northern cape. William price - country manager of egp rsa says the facility involves over 200 million euros investment in south africa. The construction of garob wind farm, which commenced in apr 2019, included the on-site building of concrete towers instead of prefabricated steel towers. the work was completed by local contractors, providing employment for about 511 people from the local community at peak of the construction phase of the project. Several creating shared value (csv) initiatives have been conducted in underserved communities that are in close proximity to the wind farm. some of these include:. Donation of wooden pallets and cable drums to the communities for making furniture. Issuing of ppe to the health workers during the peak of the covid-19 pandemic. Provision of 100 blankets to old age homes during cold winter season. Provision of food parcels to 200 vulnerable families at the height of the covid-19 lockdown. Provision of tablets for 135 grade 11 students. Granting of full scholarships to two learners to further their education at any university within south africa. Sponsorship of local sport events with 300 young people participating.   now that the site is operational, egp rsa will launch enterprise development (ed) initiatives such as the herbal lean incubation programme. the programme provides mentoring and support services to start-ups in the agro, bio and food technology field. Additional sustainability projects planned in the northern cape province include the installation of an artificial turf football field that captures and stores rainwater; a water purification facility to clean the rainwater and address water shortages by providing clean drinking water; and free wi-fi to local communities.

Five on-shore wind farms were announced in round four of reipppp. In south africa, independent power producer pele green energy (pge) has secured preferred bidder status on two wind power projects with a generation capacity of 140mw each in the eastern cape and northern cape respectively. The projects form part of the fourth bidding window for the department of energy’s renewable energy independent power producer procurement programme (reipppp). Gqi raoleka, executive director: investment & funding at pge, said: “the announcement of the winning round-four projects represents an increase of 280mw into the total portfolio of power plants for pge, raising our overall nameplate capacity of power plants to 639mw across solar and wind.”. In december 2014, pge secured an agreement to develop a 100mw csp solar project in south africa’s northern cape as part of round 3.5 of the csp-only bidding programme. Pge said in a statement that the project is currently preparing for financial close so construction can start. Commenting on the importance of the csp development, raoleka said: “this project is particularly significant due to the enormous job creation potential during construction and through the operations and maintenance phase in comparison to regular solar pv.”. “it is also significant as it will provide base-load renewable power into the south african energy grid.”. Another project in pge’s portfolio is the 88mw njoli wind farm located in the eastern cape, which reached financial close in q1 of 2015, in which the ipp is a co-shareholder. The farm, which is majority owned by enel green power, formed part of the third bidding window for reipppp, pge said in a statement. Thapelo motlogeloa, executive director: epc and o&m at pge, said: “we are looking forward to playing our role in adding more renewable-powered energy on behalf of our client to the national power grid. we aim to make a positive social contribution in the communities where projects are located, in terms of job creation and by supporting local enterprises.”.

,sawea.org.za,"November 2, 2021 in press releases. Sawea announces chair to lead wind energy transition. The south african wind energy association (sawea) has announced the re-appointment of mercia grimbeek as chair, for a second two-year term. grimbeek, who has served on the board of governance since 2018, has been part of south africa’s renewable energy sector since its inception, eleven years ago.  she will continue to lead the men and women who hold positions on this board, all of whom are charged with steering the wind energy sector and advocating for a clean and affordable energy mix, of which wind energy is a dominant part. Grimbeek, together with the board, which also remains unchanged, will usher sawea into a period of unprecedented growth, with the ramping up of new deployment and rolling procurement, which is expected. “my vision has always been to see wind power as an emancipator of transformation and growth in south africa with sawea at the helm and the association has a key role to play, now more than ever.  as our country joins its global counterparts in driving down carbon emissions, on the home-front our battle is just as pertinent as we continue to push for an accelerated transition to increased energy availability characterised by significantly larger percentages of green electrons in our power supply,” said grimbeek. Board members hold strategic leadership roles in their respective organisations, and therefore bring immense experience in the wind energy sector and particularly the renewable energy independent power producer procurement programme (rei4p), ensuring that the organisation is well positioned to provide leadership to the broader industry.  the board represents a blend of developers, ipps and oem’s, encompassing the critical role players in the wind energy value chain. 2023 large-scale renewable energy market intelligence report.

February 14, 2022 in member\'s news. Board appointment to support the drive of sustainable energy transition. Bte renewables has announced the appointment of rosalind kainyah mbe to its executive board. with 30 years of international, senior management, executive and board level exposure, kainyah’s extensive experience in sustainability, corporate and environmental law, government relations, and political risk management, add gravitas to this appointment. “rosalind offers unique and strategic insights, which we will draw on to assist our business as we expand our portfolio of renewable energy power producing projects both within south africa and the broader african continent, and thereby help transition towards a sustainable future,” commented robert skjodt, ceo of bte renewables. In sharing her views on the role of renewable energy in relation to development and her experience in this sector, kainyah, elucidates the multitude of environmental, economic, and social benefits for the hundreds of people on the african continent who aren’t yet able to access reliable energy. “at the macro scale, global demand for energy continues to rise and millions of people lack access to modern energy services. sub-saharan africa remains largely without dependable access to power, and considering the rapid population growth on the continent, this means that the current estimates of 600million is likely to increase without immediate action,” said rosalind kainyah mbe, newly appointed bte non-executive board member. At the same time, climate change means that new ways to meet the energy shortage should be addressed by renewable energy, as the best option of a sustainable future, to limit global warming. “by providing millions of people with clean electrical power, we can tackle several global and national development challenges, contributing not only to sustainable development goal (sdg) 7 – ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all – but also a host of other sdgs such as improved education quality, poverty alleviation, better health, more sustainable cities and communities, and the creation of decent jobs,” added kainyah. She sees the benefit of developing host communities, as renewable energy projects increasingly become a part of local landscapes, encouraging deliberate business strategies that support the development of communities. “by aligning business objectives with the needs and aspirations of local communities, renewable energy projects can create shared value for the business, for host communities, and for society at large. therefore, renewable energy provides developmental benefits that span across global, national, and local scales,” concluded rainyah. In both her board and advisory roles, she strategically supports company executives and management teams in advancing the interests of their businesses by harnessing environmental social and socio-economic opportunities; managing political, governance, environmental and social risks; and shaping and delivering smarter approaches to building productive relationships with key stakeholders.   as a result of her legal expertise, she is also well-versed in negotiating agreements involving and representing multiple interests with diverse and complex issues and in developing innovative solutions for disputes and to advance business opportunities.

Watch: find out how the battle for energy will affect sa. Sarec responds to state capture report and expidition of round 4 projects. The south african renewable energy council (sarec) has responded to the disclosures in the public protector’s state capture report, which were released last week. the renewable energy body, which acts as an umbrella body to the various renewable energy technologies such as the wind, solar photovoltaic and hydro energy, is of the opinion that eskom’s delay in issuing final budget quotes to preferred bidders in round 4 and round 4 extension of the renewable energy independent power producer procurement programme (reipppp) is definitely not economically motivated. The south african renewable energy council (sarec) has responded to the disclosures in the public protector’s state capture report, which were released last week. the renewable energy body, which acts as an umbrella body to the various renewable energy technologies such as the wind, solar photovoltaic and hydro energy, is of the opinion that eskom’s delay in issuing final budget quotes to preferred bidders in round 4 and round 4 extension of the renewable energy independent power producer procurement programme (reipppp) is definitely not economically motivated.   there are 26 preferred bidders across a range of technologies, none of which have reached financial close due to eskom’s refusal to sign further ppas. “these projects represent a combined value of r50bn in investment into the country that has been put on hold, which is ludicrous when considering our current economic climate,” said brenda martin, chair of sarec and ceo of the south african wind energy association. She continued saying, “the people of our country need jobs and our industry can provide them, considering that the unsigned projects represent over 13 000 jobs”. The total number of jobs expected during the construction period of these projects is 13,444; where a job is defined as 1 job = 12 person-months and 1 person-month = 160 working hours. added to this is the over-all number of jobs for south african citizens during the operations period is expected to be 1,909 per year, for a 20-year period. “it is clear from these figures that these projects represent a very significant investment in the south african economy and are vital stimuli for job creation, local content, and local economic development,” added martin. Sarec believes that this deliberate refusal to comply with the ministerial determination on renewable energy challenges the prioritisation of green energy as outlined in the national development plan. it also has a negative impact on achieving government’s green industrialisation objectives and undermines the renewable industry’s efforts in bringing much-needed foreign investment into the country. Furthermore, the delay is also hindering local manufacturing opportunities, social development programmes and the benefits of community ownership, all of which are common features of all reipppp projects. “over the past several months, eskom has repeatedly avoided signing power purchase agreements (ppas) with renewable energy independent power producers (ipps) and has failed to provide valid reasons for doing so,” said martin. she continued saying, “at the same time, eskom’s head of generation, has engaged in a sustained attack on the renewables industry, in an attempt to undermine renewable energy and protect their own narrow interests”. The industry has expressed confidence in the presidency’s office, citing a cabinet statement issued on 22 august 2016, by the minister in the presidency, jeff radebe who said that “there is no way that government will change course [on the ipp programme]”. “we therefore urge minister of energy, tina joemat-pettersson and minister of public enterprises, lynne brown to take coordinated action and ensure that policy and procedure are adhered to without further delay,” concluded martin. Since the inception of reipppp in 2011, the renewable industry has attracted more than $14 billion in direct foreign investment, created more than 20 000 jobs in construction, and 35 000 operational jobs. Reipppp has also brought about a dramatic drop in renewable energy tariffs, so much so that new-build renewable energy is now significantly cheaper than new-build coal or nuclear power. Solar photovoltaic energy: the tariff has fallen from r3.65/kwh in round 1 to r0.62/kwh in round 4. Wind energy: the cost has fallen from r1.15/kwh in round 1 to r0.62/kwh in round 4. This price is significantly lower than the tariff prices for coal from ipps (r1.03/kwh), eskom coal (r1.05/kwh to r1.16/kwh) and nuclear power which is estimated at between r1.17kwh to r1.30/kwh. Reippp enables south africa to transition away from a coal and carbon intensive power sector to a clean and sustainable future. Sarec aim’s to promote the renewable energy sector in south africa and represents a number of industry associations across a range of renewable energy technologies, like wind, solar and biogas. sarec comprises four industry associations, these are sawea, sapvia, sastela and sessa.

The south african renewable energy council (sarec) noted and responded to the resignation of eskom’s chief executive officer, mr. brian molefe, calling on a shift of attitude from the country’s electricity public utility. The south african renewable energy council (sarec) noted and responded to the resignation of eskom’s chief executive officer, mr. brian molefe, calling on a shift of attitude from the country’s electricity public utility. Sarec has in the main had a constructive working relationship with eskom around the globally successful renewable energy ipp procurement programme (reippp) since its inception in 2012. “we have, however, found the increasingly irrational and inaccurate criticisms leveled at renewable energy and the reippp programme by mr molefe and mr koko in recent months difficult to fathom, particularly since neither has ever sought to engage with the industry directly through well-established platforms to do this,” said mike levington, board member of the south african renewable energy council. Failure to follow clearly understood communication channels has led to the undermining of investor confidence in the south african ipp sector, confusion around energy policy, loss of jobs in a fledgling domestic renewable energy industry and anger amongst local communities who should have already been receiving the benefits of job creation and socio-economic dividends if eskom was fully supportive of the reippp programme. “we hope that the appointment of a new chief executive will lead to constructive communication between eskom and sarec as well as reinvigoration of momentum in the reippp programme, the financial close of the redstone csp project from round 3, the 26 projects from round 4 and the small ipp programme, and the announcement of the expedited round preferred bidders,” added levington. Sarec says that the renewable energy sector has been ready for almost 12 months to play an active contribution towards the nine point plan as articulated by president j g zuma in his most recent state of the nation address, directly in resolving the energy challenge as well as encouraging private sector investment. it is expected that after the closing of rounds 4 and the expedited round, the reippp programme will have been the cause of greater than r250 billion of investment into south africa. “with the ratification of the paris agreement on climate change and the current climate negotiations in marrakech, we also hope that eskom, nersa and other government stakeholders realize the potential that renewable energy can play in meeting both south africa’s climate change commitments as well as empowering its citizens through access to more affordable electricity. it is potential that our regional neighbours, brics partners and the world at large are embracing – so should we,” said levington. Sarec is confident that with the imminent release of the integrated resource plan approved by cabinet for public comment, and a clear vision for the future role of renewable energy technology, the sector will be able to play an even larger role in supporting investment, job creation, local manufacturing and socio-economic development in the areas of south africa that are most in need.

Jacques is a director of vuselela energy and eternity power. he is a pyro-metallurgical engineer with over 20 years experience in the ferrous, base metals, ferro-alloy and refractory industries. H1 holdings and scaled impact, supported by the industrial development corporation are launching a project management office to promote and foster collaboration across the renewable energy sector in south africa. A pilot programme in the northern cape namakwa and zf mgcawu districts together with the democracy works foundation identified more than us$ 5 billion in investment opportunities and created a linked pipeline of socio-economic development initiatives. The independent power producer industry in the northern cape has committed approximately 1.5 percent of their revenues to be re-invested into social economic and enterprise development initiatives. over twenty years this is a major investment in the future of communities. The challenge is to co-ordinate the application of these funds and resources across dozens of renewable energy projects and operators. also, to connect them to other industries with similar contributions like mining and to link all of this into the government’s wider development plans. Using these funds as a catalyst for projects, to match third party funds, to close service gaps, to raise skills and involve marginal communities can put the entire region on a positive development path for the next twenty years and more. The renewable energy investor h1 holdings together with the project developer scaled impact and the social justice ngo, the democracy works foundation, concluded the design of a mechanism to deliver this collaboration. Backed by the idc they developed a twenty year perspective on the development potential in a region from namakwaland to upington, matching the locations and timing of various solar and wind farm investments in which h1 is a shareholder. They identified a base of great value in the region. world-scale strategic mineral reserves in a solar and wind energy corridor give the area a head-start in potential manufacturing for future green industries from solar panels to batteries. Grape, date and citrus farms supply world markets and have large expansion potential. up to 4,000 hectares of suitable land are potentially open for establishment by emerging farmers. the orange river valley is the second largest raisin producing region in the world enabling new, community- owned production. the team is already working to support implementation. Other opportunities in high tech automotive testing and r&d and aviation recycling provide a base for a high tech cluster. around this the region is a global bio-diversity hotspot. natural resources in flora and fauna can be preserved through reserves, protective farming practices and bio-technology applications to create a bio-diversity economy. Investments in the natural environment are particularly valuable as ways for work with the nama, khoi and san peoples living in remoter areas, for adapting life to climate change and protecting fragile natural capital. The team identified a set of investments in healthcare, social services, energy and water infrastructure and telecoms infrastructure that aim to raise living standards and improve livelihoods steadily. citizen participation, enabling people to contribute to government planning and democratic processes is at the heart of this activity. Finally, a framework was created to monitor and evaluate ipp social and economic development and enterprise development activities. it fully links the requirements of the ipp office, provincial and national government policy and the un sustainable development goals (sdgs). The project management office has a wide mandate across sectors and a long time horizon. it will spend the next year engaging with stakeholders and representatives. it will establish implementation partnerships at the provincial and national level. it will gather resources and set up to deliver transformational community growth and development, to maximise the benefits and positive impact of the renewable energy sector. above all, it is driving the implementation of development projects.
